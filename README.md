Assignment1

This repository contains a complete Playwright automation testing project created as part of the assignment. The project is used to test the Tamil Changathi (Thanglish to Tamil Translator) web application. All required test scripts, Playwright configuration files, and supporting files are included in this repository. The Git repository is public, and the repository link is provided separately as requested.

To use this project, Node.js must be installed on your system since it includes npm for managing dependencies. First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine. After cloning, open the project folder using Visual Studio Code or any code editor. Open a terminal inside the project directory and run npm install to install all the required dependencies. Once the installation is complete, install the Playwright browsers by running npx playwright install.

After setting up the project, the test cases can be executed using Playwright commands. To run all the automated tests, use the command npx playwright test. This will run all positive, negative, and UI test cases across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. If you want to see the browser while the tests are running, you can use npx playwright test --headed.

When the test execution is finished, Playwright automatically generates an HTML test report. This report shows detailed information about the test results, including passed and failed test cases. The report can be opened by running npx playwright show-report in the terminal.

This project is structured clearly to make it easy to understand and run. All necessary instructions to install dependencies and execute the tests are included in this README file to ensure smooth evaluation during marking.
